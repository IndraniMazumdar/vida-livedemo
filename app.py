I used to love cooking, gymming, taking my dog out for walks, but I don't know. It's not been the same anymore. I think I'm losing zeal, confidence in life.
People keep asking me if I'm happy or if I'm satisfied. I just keep nodding and saying yes to things, but I don't know if I really feel like that anymore.\"\"\"
